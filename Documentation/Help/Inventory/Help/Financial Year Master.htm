            Financial Year Master </li>
        <li>Enter the meaningful name for Financial Year name box. E.g. FY1415, FY1516.</li>
        <li>Select from date and to date for the financial year. Make sure your financial year
            is not conflicting with any other financial year.</li>
        <li>should be only one active financial year at a moment. At yearend activity, current
            year financial year is supposed to be deactivated and new financial year should
            be created.<br />
            (Use active checkbox on the screen for activation and deactivation)</li>
        <li>Financial year cancellation option is provided to enable correction. Consider you
            created a financial year by selecting invalid date or name, so now if you wish to
            make correction,<br />
            you should cancel the invalid financial year and create new financial year.</li>
        <li>Once a financial year is created, it will not show in system.<br />
            (Note, any transaction which is done for any cancelled financial year will not be
            shown in report, also it will not be searchable in system.)</li>
